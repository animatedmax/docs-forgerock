title: ForgeRock Service Broker for Pivotal Cloud Foundry
owner: Partners
---

The ForgeRock Service Broker allows Cloud Foundry applications to access 
OAuth 2.0 features provided by the ForgeRock Identity Platform. 
Integrate with the ForgeRock Identity Platform to:

* Obtain OAuth 2.0 access tokens using the client credentials grant type.
* Validate OAuth 2.0 access tokens or OpenID Connect ID tokens passed 
your application.

The ForgeRock Service Broker automates the process of creating OAuth 2.0 
client profiles, and requires a set of credentials with privileges for 
adding and removing OAuth 2.0 clients. The recommended approach is to 
create a new user in OpenAM, add the user to a new group, and give that 
group the `AgentAdmin` privilege, allowing members to create and remove 
OAuth 2.0 clients. 

For information on creating a user and delegating privileges, see
